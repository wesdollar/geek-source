## Mockups

We've provided desktop and mobile designs, each available as a flat file for reference. The master design file is available, too, for those who have Photoshop or GIMP.

> Pro Tip:
Be sure to account for tablet displays. We didn't provide mockups for tablets, but you should be able to borrow plenty of ideas from the desktop and mobile versions to provide a great UX.
